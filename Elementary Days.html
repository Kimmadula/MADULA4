 		<div class="All"> <blockquote>My elementary experience is full of fun and excitement. It is hard and full of adventure, too. Elementary life is very challenging and I am proud to complete it. I was a energetic boy who do silly things with my friends we share jokes and laughters at school.But in my elementary level, I learned many things from my subjects and from my encounters with bestfriends. Sometimes we are being scolded by our teachers due to being very “makulit”. It is there that we do not listen to our lesson, sometimes we copy each others assignments and we tease each other. I spent my Elementary Days in <i>Naawan Central School</i>, that school was fun and I enjoy it.</blockquote></div>
