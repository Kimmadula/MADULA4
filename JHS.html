			<div class="All"> When i think about my high school experience, there are many things that come to mind. Some of them are:good memories, bad memories, mistakes, lessons, drama, and most importantly fun. High School to me seemed like it past by really fast, almost too fast sometimes. I learned many valuable life lessons as well as made life long friends.My friends and I do cutting classes just so we can play computer games. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the company of your friends is what makes the events so fun and exciting. I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and also how to tell your real friends from the others. It was tough but overall a great experience that I miss. These 4 years has been an overall life changing experience that I will never forget.</div>
